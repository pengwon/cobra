# COBRA SCOPE

[中文](README_zh.md)

## Introduction

This is an open-source project based on infrared temperature imaging, aimed at helping engineers discover and resolve anomalies during the debugging process. This project uses thermal imaging to find heat issues in the system, assisting in the detection and diagnosis of circuit problems, thereby improving the stability and performance of the system.

## Features

- **Infrared Temperature Imaging**: With infrared technology, it is possible to measure the temperature of an object without contact, thereby reducing interference with the device.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: This project supports real-time monitoring, allowing for immediate problem discovery and resolution.
- **Ease of Use**: We provide detailed instructions and examples, making it easy for even users with no relevant experience to get started quickly.
- **Open Source**: This project is completely open source, and we welcome anyone to participate and contribute.
